# Invoicing ROI Simulator

This is a full-stack web application that helps users simulate the Return on Investment (ROI), potential savings, and payback period of switching from a manual to an automated invoicing system.

The application allows users to input their current invoicing metrics, run a simulation, view the results, save different scenarios, and generate a PDF report for a saved scenario.
